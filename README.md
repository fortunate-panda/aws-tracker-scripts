This project provides a Shell script that automates the tracking of AWS resources to help organizations manage costs and ensure resource manageability. The script reports on four key AWS services:

S3: Lists all storage buckets.

EC2: Lists Instance IDs for all virtual servers.

Lambda: Lists all serverless functions.

IAM: Lists all users within the AWS account.
